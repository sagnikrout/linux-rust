// DOC: Page mobility and placement hints
//
// Page mobility and placement hints
// ---------------------------------
//
// These flags provide hints about how mobile the page is. Pages with similar
// mobility are placed within the same pageblocks to minimise problems due
// to external fragmentation.
//
// %__GFP_MOVABLE (also a zone modifier) indicates that the page can be
// moved by page migration during memory compaction or can be reclaimed.
//
// %__GFP_RECLAIMABLE is used for slab allocations that specify
// SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT and whose pages can be freed via shrinkers.
//
// %__GFP_WRITE indicates the caller intends to dirty the page. Where possible,
// these pages will be spread between local zones to avoid all the dirty
// pages being in one zone (fair zone allocation policy).
//
// %__GFP_HARDWALL enforces the cpuset memory allocation policy.
//
// %__GFP_THISNODE forces the allocation to be satisfied from the requested
// node with no fallbacks or placement policy enforcements.
//
// %__GFP_ACCOUNT causes the allocation to be accounted to kmemcg.
//

//
// DOC: Watermark modifiers
//
// Watermark modifiers -- controls access to emergency reserves
// ------------------------------------------------------------
//
// %__GFP_HIGH indicates that the caller is high-priority and that granting
// the request is necessary before the system can make forward progress.
// For example creating an IO context to clean pages and requests
// from atomic context.
//
// %__GFP_MEMALLOC allows access to all memory. This should only be used when
// the caller guarantees the allocation will allow more memory to be freed
// very shortly e.g. process exiting or swapping. Users either should
// be the MM or co-ordinating closely with the VM (e.g. swap over NFS).
// Users of this flag have to be extremely careful to not deplete the reserve
// completely and implement a throttling mechanism which controls the
// consumption of the reserve based on the amount of freed memory.
// Usage of a pre-allocated pool (e.g. mempool) should be always considered
// before using this flag.
//
// %__GFP_NOMEMALLOC is used to explicitly forbid access to emergency reserves.
// This takes precedence over the %__GFP_MEMALLOC flag if both are set.
//

//
// DOC: Reclaim modifiers
//
// Reclaim modifiers
// -----------------
// Please note that all the following flags are only applicable to sleepable
// allocations (e.g. %GFP_NOWAIT and %GFP_ATOMIC will ignore them).
//
// %__GFP_IO can start physical IO.
//
// %__GFP_FS can call down to the low-level FS. Clearing the flag avoids the
// allocator recursing into the filesystem which might already be holding
// locks.
//
// %__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM indicates that the caller may enter direct reclaim.
// This flag can be cleared to avoid unnecessary delays when a fallback
// option is available.
//
// %__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM indicates that the caller wants to wake kswapd when
// the low watermark is reached and have it reclaim pages until the high
// watermark is reached. A caller may wish to clear this flag when fallback
// options are available and the reclaim is likely to disrupt the system. The
// canonical example is THP allocation where a fallback is cheap but
// reclaim/compaction may cause indirect stalls.
//
// %__GFP_RECLAIM is shorthand to allow/forbid both direct and kswapd reclaim.
//
// The default allocator behavior depends on the request size. We have a concept
// of so-called costly allocations (with order > %PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER).
// !costly allocations are too essential to fail so they are implicitly
// non-failing by default (with some exceptions like OOM victims might fail so
// the caller still has to check for failures) while costly requests try to be
// not disruptive and back off even without invoking the OOM killer.
// The following three modifiers might be used to override some of these
// implicit rules. Please note that all of them must be used along with
// %__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM flag.
//
// %__GFP_NORETRY: The VM implementation will try only very lightweight
// memory direct reclaim to get some memory under memory pressure (thus
// it can sleep). It will avoid disruptive actions like OOM killer. The
// caller must handle the failure which is quite likely to happen under
// heavy memory pressure. The flag is suitable when failure can easily be
// handled at small cost, such as reduced throughput.
//
// %__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL: The VM implementation will retry memory reclaim
// procedures that have previously failed if there is some indication
// that progress has been made elsewhere.  It can wait for other
// tasks to attempt high-level approaches to freeing memory such as
// compaction (which removes fragmentation) and page-out.
// There is still a definite limit to the number of retries, but it is
// a larger limit than with %__GFP_NORETRY.
// Allocations with this flag may fail, but only when there is
// genuinely little unused memory. While these allocations do not
// directly trigger the OOM killer, their failure indicates that
// the system is likely to need to use the OOM killer soon.  The
// caller must handle failure, but can reasonably do so by failing
// a higher-level request, or completing it only in a much less
// efficient manner.
// If the allocation does fail, and the caller is in a position to
// free some non-essential memory, doing so could benefit the system
// as a whole.
//
// %__GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
// cannot handle allocation failures. The allocation could block
// indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for
// failure is pointless.
// It _must_ be blockable and used together with __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM.
// It should _never_ be used in non-sleepable contexts.
// New users should be evaluated carefully (and the flag should be
// used only when there is no reasonable failure policy) but it is
// definitely preferable to use the flag rather than opencode endless
// loop around allocator.
// Allocating pages from the buddy with __GFP_NOFAIL and order > 1 is
// not supported. Please consider using kvmalloc() instead.
//

//
// DOC: Action modifiers
//
// Action modifiers
// ----------------
//
// %__GFP_NOWARN suppresses allocation failure reports.
//
// %__GFP_COMP address compound page metadata.
//
// %__GFP_ZERO returns a zeroed page on success.
//
// %__GFP_ZEROTAGS zeroes memory tags at allocation time. Setting memory tags at
// the same time as zeroing memory (e.g., with __GFP_ZERO) has minimal
// additional performance impact. However, __GFP_ZEROTAGS also zeroes the tags
// even if memory is not getting zeroed at allocation time (e.g.,
// with init_on_free).
//
// %__GFP_SKIP_KASAN makes KASAN skip unpoisoning on page allocation.
// Used for userspace and vmalloc pages; the latter are unpoisoned by
// kasan_unpoison_vmalloc instead. If passed to vmalloc, kasan_unpoison_vmalloc
// is skipped too. For userspace pages, results in poisoning being skipped as
// well, see should_skip_kasan_poison for details. Only effective in HW_TAGS mode.

// DOC: Useful GFP flag combinations
//
// Useful GFP flag combinations
// ----------------------------
//
// Useful GFP flag combinations that are commonly used. It is recommended
// that subsystems start with one of these combinations and then set/clear
// %__GFP_FOO flags as necessary.
//
// %GFP_ATOMIC users can not sleep and need the allocation to succeed. A lower
// watermark is applied to allow access to "atomic reserves".
// The current implementation doesn't support NMI, nor contexts that disable
// preemption under PREEMPT_RT. This includes raw_spin_lock() and plain
// preempt_disable() - see "Memory allocation" in
// Documentation/core-api/real-time/differences.rst for more info.
//
// %GFP_KERNEL is typical for kernel-internal allocations. The caller requires
// %ZONE_NORMAL or a lower zone for direct access but can direct reclaim.
//
// %GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT is the same as GFP_KERNEL, except the allocation is
// accounted to kmemcg.
//
// %GFP_NOWAIT is for kernel allocations that should not stall for direct
// reclaim, start physical IO or use any filesystem callback.  It is very
// likely to fail to allocate memory, even for very small allocations.
// The same restrictions on calling contexts apply as for %GFP_ATOMIC.
//
// %GFP_NOIO will use direct reclaim to discard clean pages or slab pages
// that do not require the starting of any physical IO.
// Please try to avoid using this flag directly and instead use
// memalloc_noio_{save,restore} to mark the whole scope which cannot
// perform any IO with a short explanation why. All allocation requests
// will inherit GFP_NOIO implicitly.
//
// %GFP_NOFS will use direct reclaim but will not use any filesystem interfaces.
// Please try to avoid using this flag directly and instead use
// memalloc_nofs_{save,restore} to mark the whole scope which cannot/shouldn't
// recurse into the FS layer with a short explanation why. All allocation
// requests will inherit GFP_NOFS implicitly.
//
// %GFP_USER is for userspace allocations that also need to be directly
// accessibly by the kernel or hardware. It is typically used by hardware
// for buffers that are mapped to userspace (e.g. graphics) that hardware
// still must DMA to. cpuset limits are enforced for these allocations.
//
// %GFP_DMA exists for historical reasons and should be avoided where possible.
// The flags indicates that the caller requires that the lowest zone be
// used (%ZONE_DMA or 16M on x86-64). Ideally, this would be removed but
// it would require careful auditing as some users really require it and
// others use the flag to avoid lowmem reserves in %ZONE_DMA and treat the
// lowest zone as a type of emergency reserve.
//
// %GFP_DMA32 is similar to %GFP_DMA except that the caller requires a 32-bit
// address. Note that kmalloc(..., GFP_DMA32) does not return DMA32 memory
// because the DMA32 kmalloc cache array is not implemented.
// (Reason: there is no such user in kernel).
//
// %GFP_HIGHUSER is for userspace allocations that may be mapped to userspace,
// do not need to be directly accessible by the kernel but that cannot
// move once in use. An example may be a hardware allocation that maps
// data directly into userspace but has no addressing limitations.
//
// %GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is for userspace allocations that the kernel does not
// need direct access to but can use kmap() when access is required. They
// are expected to be movable via page reclaim or page migration. Typically,
// pages on the LRU would also be allocated with %GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.
//
// %GFP_TRANSHUGE and %GFP_TRANSHUGE_LIGHT are used for THP allocations. They
// are compound allocations that will generally fail quickly if memory is not
// available and will not wake kswapd/kcompactd on failure. The _LIGHT
// version does not attempt reclaim/compaction at all and is by default used
// in page fault path, while the non-light is used by khugepaged.
