// This header exists to force full rebuild when the compiler is upgraded.
//
// When fixdep scans this, it will find this string "CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT"
// and add dependency on include/config/CC_VERSION_TEXT, which is touched
// by Kconfig when the version string from the compiler changes.
//
// Additional tree-wide dependencies start here.
//
// If any of the GCC plugins change, we need to rebuild everything that
// was built with them, as they may have changed their behavior and those
// behaviors may need to be synchronized across all translation units.
//

//
// If the randstruct seed itself changes (whether for GCC plugins or
// Clang), the entire tree needs to be rebuilt since the randomization of
// structures may change between compilation units if not.
//

//
// If any external changes affect Clang's integer wrapping sanitizer
// behavior, a full rebuild is needed as the coverage for wrapping types
// may have changed, which may impact the expected behaviors that should
// not differ between compilation units.
