// FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file

// being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is "collapsed"),
// resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
// removed never existed. As such collapsing a range of a file changes
// the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
// that has been removed by the operation.
//
// Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
// granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
// filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
// smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the

// extent or do whatever which will result in reading zeros from the range
// while the range remains allocated for the file.

// significant metadata changes. Therefore, filesystems that always require
// out-of-place writes should not support this flag.
